# canny-edge-detector
Canny edge detector for my A-Level project.

## Setup
### Installing Go
To install Go, click [here](https://go.dev/doc/install).

### Souce code
To get the source code, run:
```
git clone https://github.com/hhharrisonnn/canny-edge-detector.git
```
I've only used the standard Go library, so all dependcies/packages should already work if you've got Go installed.

### Starting the server
To start the web server, simply run:
```
go run main.go
```
